## Usage

<!-- <img src="/public/assets/images/notetakergif.gif" alt="GIF of using the application"/> -->

Keep a tally as you devour Bob's delicious burgers of the day. Devour the burgers with a click of a button, or regurgitate them in the same manner. Delete the burger when you get tired of it, and add new burgers with original titles and descriptions.

## Roadmap

Future versions will clean up the front end with better graphics and icons. Additionally, a larger database would be created in order to divulge in a wider selection of Bob's burgers.
